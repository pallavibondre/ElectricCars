<p style="font-size:28;color:white;margin-left:75;margin-right:300px">The electric vehicle power source is the battery which acts as a "gas tank" and supplies the electric motor with the energy necessary to move the vehicle. An electric car is an automobile that is propelled by one or more electric motors, using energy stored in rechargeable batteries.</p>

<p style="font-size:28;color:white;margin-left:75;margin-right:300px">Electric cars run on electrical energy. Electric cars have an electric motor that is powered by a fuel cell. Some batteries from the electric cars can last for at least 12 to 15 years. There are four kinds of batteries: lithium-ion, nickel- metal hydride, lead-acid, and ultracapacitors. Lithium-ion batteries are mostly used for portable electronics and electric vechiles. One advantage for the Nickel-Metal Hydribe battery is that Energy's density can be changed into long run times or reduction in the space necessary for the battery. Lead acid was the first recharable battery invented. Lead acid is commenly made out of antimony,calicum,tin,and selenium. </p>

<p style="font-size:28;color:white;margin-left:75;margin-right:300px"> Electric Cars have been in existence for as long as gasoline cars. But electric cars tend to be more expensive than gas powered cars.
The electric cars was an interest in the 1970’s when gas prices started getting more expensive. 
In the 1990s, there were problems with transportation emissions which led to modifying  models of electric power cars. Also known as the GM‘s EV1 electric vehicle. However, the high price made it impossible from becoming a commercially viable. </p>
